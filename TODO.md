- ~~ShaderLoader will probably be removed, or be transparent to the user~~
- Passing parameters to WAGNER.ShaderPass from main code
- ~~Correct use of textures of different dimensions along the chain~~
- ~~Multiple Composers working at the same time~~
- Shaders that are not ported to WAGNER.Pass: pixelate, rgb split, different single-pass bloom
- Shaders that haven't even been ported to WAGNER: SSAO, DOF, camera motion blur, directional blur, gamma, levels, edge detection
- Alias definition of passes (previously loadPass()) legacy
- uniform reflection from GLSL source doesn't support structures (I don't even know if WebGL supports structures)
- something is wrong with alpha: some additive effects are different when using RGB/RGBA format
